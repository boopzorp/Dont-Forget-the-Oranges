  prompt: `You are an expert at reading handwritten or digital grocery lists from images.
Your task is to analyze the provided image, identify each distinct grocery item, its quantity, its price, and classify it into one of the following categories: ${categoryNames.join(', ')}.

- Identify each item on the list.
- Extract a concise, clean name for the item. The goal is to remove brand names and descriptive words unless they are essential. For example:
  - "iD Homestyle Whole Wheat Paratha" should become "Whole Wheat Paratha".
  - "Britannia 100% Whole Wheat Bread" should become "Whole Wheat Bread".
  - "Heritage Cup Curd" should become "Curd".
  - "Daawat Basmati Rice" should become "Basmati Rice".
  - "Safal Frozen Mixed Vegetables" should become "Mixed Vegetables".
  - For simple items like "Egg", "Tomato", "Paneer", "Green Chilli", use just that single word.
  - For uniquely branded items where the brand is the common name, like "Munch chocolate", "Kitkat", or "Cheetos", use the brand and product name.
- Extract the quantity for each item. Look for multipliers like "x 2", "x 1", etc. The number after the 'x' is the quantity. If a quantity is not explicitly mentioned, assume it is 1.
- Extract the price for each item if it's available.
- **VERY IMPORTANT**: If an item's quantity is greater than 1, the listed price is likely the total for all units. You MUST calculate the per-unit price by dividing the total price by the quantity. The 'price' field in your output must be the price for a single unit. For example, if "Aam Panna Mango Drink" is listed as "200 ml x 2" for "â‚¹76", the quantity is 2 and the per-unit price is 38.
- Ignore any other notes. Focus only on the item name, price, and quantity.
- For each item, choose the most appropriate category from the provided list.
- Items like "Chips", "Chocolates", "Beverages" should be categorized as 'Snacks'.
- If an item doesn't fit well into any category, classify it as 'Other'.
- Do not return items that are not groceries (e.g. "My Grocery List", "Weekly Shop", numbers, etc).
